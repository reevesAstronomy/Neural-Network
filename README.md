# Neural-Network
Feedforward network trained using gradient descent and backpropagation.

"Network.py" contains the code for the neural network. "backprop-data.pkl" is the example training data file containing (x,y) coordinates paired with binary labels (1 or 0). Two contour plots were used to illustrate the classification behaviour of the network before training and after training.

Generalizability note: The network by default only has two input nodes (plus a bias weighting node), but this can be generalized to any number. The hidden layer of 10 nodes and the output layer of one node (for a 1 or 0 output in the example given) can also be changed for dealing with different types of data/problems.
